# Deployment

The bridge should run close to OpenClaw and should expose only the Shortcut webhook route through HTTPS.

## Minimal deployment

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
cp examples/env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`, then start:

```bash
node dist/src/index.js
```

## macOS launchd note

LaunchAgents often start with a minimal `PATH`. If `OPENCLAW_CLI_BIN` points at an OpenClaw shim that uses `/usr/bin/env node`, include Homebrew in the service environment:

```text
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

## Reverse proxy

Expose:

```text
POST /shortcuts/message
GET /healthz
```

Do not expose queue files, logs, OpenClaw admin routes, shell access, or local runtime dashboards.

## Delivery modes

The default CLI delivery path queues Shortcut requests immediately and drains them through `openclaw agent` in the background. This gives Siri/Shortcuts a fast `202 Accepted` response even when the agent turn takes longer.

For a Telegram direct-message experience, point `OPENCLAW_SESSION_KEY` at the existing Telegram session and ask OpenClaw to deliver the assistant response back to Telegram:

```text
OPENCLAW_ADAPTER=cli
OPENCLAW_SESSION_KEY=agent:jay:telegram:default:direct:brian
OPENCLAW_DELIVER_REPLY=true
OPENCLAW_REPLY_CHANNEL=telegram
OPENCLAW_REPLY_TO=telegram:1234567890
OPENCLAW_MESSAGE_STYLE=compact
SIRI_MESSAGE_PREFIX=Sent via Apple Watch voice message:
```

That mode does not send a Telegram message as the human user. It injects the transcript into the OpenClaw session that backs the Telegram direct chat, then delivers Jay's response to the configured Telegram target.
