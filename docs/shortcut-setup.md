# Apple Shortcut setup

You can either create the Shortcut manually on iPhone, or generate a signed `.shortcut` file with Cherri and import it.

Do not commit generated Shortcut artifacts. They contain the bearer token.

## Generate with Cherri

The repo includes a token-free Cherri template at `examples/tell-jay.cherri.template` and a helper script that generates a signed Shortcut locally.

On macOS:

```bash
export SIRI_BRIDGE_URL='https://your-public-bridge.example.com/shortcuts/message'
export SIRI_BRIDGE_TOKEN='your-long-random-token'
./scripts/build-shortcut.sh
```

The script writes:

```text
artifacts/shortcuts/Tell Jay.shortcut
artifacts/shortcuts/Tell Jay.cherri
```

`Tell Jay.cherri` is the rendered source and contains the bearer token. `Tell Jay.shortcut` is signed and ready to import. Both paths are ignored by git.

By default, the script downloads the Cherri release binary for the local Mac architecture. To use an existing Cherri binary:

```bash
CHERRI_BIN=/path/to/cherri ./scripts/build-shortcut.sh
```

Optional settings:

```bash
SHORTCUT_NAME='Tell Jay' \
SHORTCUT_SIGN_MODE='contacts' \
CHERRI_VERSION='v2.3.0' \
OUTPUT_DIR="$PWD/artifacts/shortcuts" \
./scripts/build-shortcut.sh
```

`SHORTCUT_SIGN_MODE=contacts` maps to Cherri's contacts signing mode. Use `SHORTCUT_SIGN_MODE=anyone` only if you are comfortable sharing the Shortcut more broadly. Apple notes that signing validates the Shortcut for sharing.

Send the generated `.shortcut` file to the iPhone through AirDrop, Mail, Messages, or iCloud Drive, then open it on the iPhone and approve the import. Apple requires the user import step.

The generated Shortcut:

1. Uses `Dictate Text`.
2. Checks that a message was captured.
3. Sends a JSON `POST` to `/shortcuts/message`.
4. Adds `Authorization: Bearer <SIRI_BRIDGE_TOKEN>`.
5. Speaks `Sent to Jay` after the request.

After import, enable `Show on Apple Watch` in the Shortcut details.

## Manual Shortcut actions

## Shortcut actions

Name the shortcut something Siri can hear reliably, for example `Tell Jay`.

1. Add `Dictate Text`.
2. Add `Set Variable`; name it `message`.
3. Add `If`: `message` has no value.
4. Inside that branch, add `Speak Text` with `No message captured`, then `Stop This Shortcut`.
5. Add `Dictionary` with:
   - `message`: `message`
   - `source`: `siri_watch`
   - `device_name`: `Apple Watch`
   - `shortcut_name`: `Tell Jay`
   - `captured_at`: current date formatted as ISO 8601
6. Add `Get Contents of URL`.
7. Set URL to `https://your-public-bridge.example.com/shortcuts/message`.
8. Set Method to `POST`.
9. Add headers:
   - `Authorization`: `Bearer your-long-random-token`
   - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
10. Set Request Body to `JSON` and pass the dictionary.
11. Parse the response dictionary and `Speak Text` using the `spoken` value.

## Apple Watch

In the Shortcut details on iPhone, turn on `Show on Apple Watch`.

You can then run it from:

- Siri: `Hey Siri, Tell Jay`;
- the Shortcuts app on Apple Watch;
- a watch-face complication;
- the Action Button on Apple Watch Ultra models.

## Siri behavior

Siri generally does not pass arbitrary free-form text after the shortcut name as one clean utterance. The reliable interaction is:

1. Say `Hey Siri, Tell Jay`.
2. Wait for dictation.
3. Speak the message.
4. Let the shortcut POST the transcript.

## Sharing and device sync

Apple supports sharing shortcuts through iCloud links or as `.shortcut` files, and it supports syncing shortcuts across Apple devices when iCloud Sync is enabled. The practical install flow is:

1. Create or import the shortcut on iPhone or Mac.
2. Confirm the URL and bearer token during import/setup.
3. Enable `Show on Apple Watch`.
4. Let iCloud Sync copy it to the watch.

The macOS `shortcuts` command can run, view, and sign shortcut files, but it does not provide a supported command to generate and install a new multi-action shortcut directly onto an iPhone. If you create a shareable shortcut template, the bridge repo can host the signed `.shortcut` file and users can import it with Apple's normal approval flow.

The bearer token is intentionally not stored in this repository.
