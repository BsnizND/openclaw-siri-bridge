# openclaw-siri-bridge

Authenticated Apple Shortcuts/Siri webhook bridge for sending voice notes and shared iOS content to OpenClaw.

Most Siri/LLM shortcuts end with a spoken answer, a copied snippet, or another app popping open. `openclaw-siri-bridge` does something more practical: it lets you send a thought, file, screenshot, link, or voice memo to your self-hosted OpenClaw assistant and get the reply back in the chat you already use, such as Telegram.

The phone or watch is just the capture device. The assistant thread stays the place where the work happens.

This repo is built around two user stories:

1. **Talk to OpenClaw from your watch or phone via Siri.** Say `Hey Siri, Talk to OpenClaw`, dictate a message, and get OpenClaw's response back in your Telegram chat.
2. **Share anything from your phone to OpenClaw.** Share a voice memo, link, tweet, photo, PDF, file, selected text, or webpage to OpenClaw and receive the response in Telegram.

The bridge is assistant-agnostic. Configure the OpenClaw session and Telegram reply route for your own deployment.

This project is an independent integration. It is not affiliated with Apple, Telegram, or OpenClaw maintainers unless stated otherwise.

## What makes it different

- **Hands-free capture:** invoke Siri through AirPods, dictate the request, and let OpenClaw reply in the chat thread where the assistant already lives.
- **Apple Watch capture:** send quick thoughts, errands, reminders, and location-aware questions without taking out your phone.
- **Share sheet capture:** send links, tweets, screenshots, photos, PDFs, files, selected text, webpages, and voice memos to OpenClaw from almost any iOS app.
- **One conversation loop:** Shortcuts stays quiet on success. The assistant response in Telegram or your configured channel is the confirmation.
- **Agent-buildable setup:** token-free Cherri templates and docs let Codex or another coding agent generate the local `.shortcut` files for you.

## Building Your Personal Context Layer

The share sheet turns this from a voice shortcut into a way to collect useful context as you move through the day. Pair this bridge with a second-brain system, LLM wiki, personal knowledge base, or OpenClaw memory pipeline, and the things you send can become reusable material for the assistant.

The loop becomes:

1. Notice something worth keeping.
2. Share it from the app you are already using.
3. Let OpenClaw respond now.
4. Let your memory layer keep it around for later.

Over time, the assistant has more of your actual context: the links you saved, the screenshots you sent, the notes you dictated, the places you asked about, and the projects you keep returning to. The base model is not changing. The context layer around it is.

## Features

- `POST /shortcuts/message` for Apple Shortcuts.
- `POST /shortcuts/share` for iOS/iPadOS share-sheet text, URLs, files, images, PDFs, and audio.
- Bearer-token authentication.
- Source allowlist for `siri_watch`, `siri_iphone`, and custom Shortcut clients.
- Message length limits and payload validation.
- Fast `202 Accepted` response for Siri/Shortcuts.
- Durable JSONL queue for pending work, with delivered/failed outcomes archived separately.
- Background delivery to OpenClaw through CLI or HTTP ingest.
- Optional OpenClaw reply delivery back to a messaging channel, such as an existing Telegram chat.
- Optional structured location context, including latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy, and a map URL.
- Optional voice memo metadata/transcript context for Shortcuts that can provide an audio transcript.
- Optional server-side audio transcription for shared Voice Memos/audio files.
- Shortcut-friendly `spoken` response field for error notifications.

## Non-goals

- Replacing Siri, Apple Shortcuts, or OpenClaw.
- Public exposure of OpenClaw admin/runtime surfaces.
- Creating or changing OpenClaw worker-agent topology.
- One-shot Siri phrases like `Hey Siri, Talk to OpenClaw remember dog food`.

For arbitrary text, Siri/Shortcuts is most reliable as a two-step interaction: invoke the shortcut, then dictate.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp examples/env.example .env
npm run build
npm start
```

Generate a token:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Set that value as `SIRI_BRIDGE_TOKEN` in `.env` and in the Apple Shortcut `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## API

### `GET /healthz`

Returns:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

### `POST /shortcuts/message`

Headers:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
  "message": "Remind me to send the draft tomorrow",
  "source": "siri_watch",
  "device_name": "Apple Watch",
  "shortcut_name": "Talk to OpenClaw",
  "captured_at": "2026-06-13T16:00:00.000Z",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 33.6001,
    "longitude": -111.9002,
    "altitude": 510,
    "horizontal_accuracy": 12,
    "maps_url": "https://maps.apple.com/?ll=33.6001,-111.9002"
  }
}
```

### `POST /shortcuts/share`

Headers:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Form fields:

- `file`: optional shared file/audio/image/PDF.
- `shared_text`: optional text extracted from the share-sheet input.
- `shared_url`: optional shared URL.
- `shared_title`: optional shared title.
- `location_json`: optional JSON object with `latitude`, `longitude`, `altitude`, and `maps_url`.
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `altitude`, `maps_url`: optional plain form-field alternative to `location_json`.
- `source`: defaults to `ios_share_sheet`.

When `AUDIO_TRANSCRIBE_ENABLED=true`, audio uploads are transcribed server-side before the event is queued for OpenClaw. The generated share-sheet Shortcut sends screenshots/images as multipart `file` uploads so the assistant can inspect the image server-side.

For voice memo workflows, send a transcript as either the main `message` or as `voice_memo.transcript`:

```json
{
  "message": "Shared via iPhone voice memo: <transcript>",
  "source": "siri_iphone",
  "voice_memo": {
    "transcript": "Full transcript text here",
    "filename": "New Recording.m4a",
    "duration_seconds": 74,
    "recorded_at": "2026-06-13T16:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "queued": true,
  "id": "request-id",
  "spoken": "Sent to openclaw"
}
```

The generated Shortcuts are silent on success. They read `spoken` only when
the bridge returns an error, so a normal send is confirmed by the assistant's
reply in the destination channel instead of by Siri or an iOS notification.

## Configuration

Important settings:

- `SIRI_BRIDGE_TOKEN`: long random shared secret used by the Shortcut.

- `SIRI_MESSAGE_PREFIX`: optional prefix for compact voice messages, for example `Sent via Siri voice message:`.
- `QUEUE_PATH`: JSONL queue path.
- `QUEUE_ARCHIVE_PATH`: JSONL archive path for delivered/failed queue records. Defaults to `QUEUE_PATH + ".archive"`.
