# openclaw-siri-bridge

Authenticated Apple Shortcuts/Siri webhook bridge for sending dictated messages into OpenClaw.

The common use case is an Apple Watch shortcut:

1. Say `Hey Siri, Tell Jay`.
2. Dictate a quick message.
3. The Shortcut POSTs the transcript to this bridge.
4. The bridge queues the event and delivers it to OpenClaw in the background.

The bridge is assistant-agnostic. `jay` is only the default example assistant id.

## Features

- `POST /shortcuts/message` for Apple Shortcuts.
- Bearer-token authentication.
- Source allowlist for `siri_watch`, `siri_iphone`, and custom Shortcut clients.
- Message length limits and payload validation.
- Fast `202 Accepted` response for Siri/Shortcuts.
- Durable JSONL queue with delivered/failed status.
- Background delivery to OpenClaw through CLI or HTTP ingest.
- Optional OpenClaw reply delivery back to a messaging channel, such as an existing Telegram direct session.
- Shortcut-friendly `spoken` response field for confirmation.

## Non-goals

- Replacing Siri, Apple Shortcuts, or OpenClaw.
- Public exposure of OpenClaw admin/runtime surfaces.
- Creating or changing OpenClaw worker-agent topology.
- One-shot Siri phrases like `Hey Siri, Tell Jay remember dog food`.

For arbitrary text, Siri/Shortcuts is most reliable as a two-step interaction: invoke the shortcut, then dictate.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp examples/env.example .env
npm run build
npm start
```

Generate a token:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Set that value as `SIRI_BRIDGE_TOKEN` in `.env` and in the Apple Shortcut `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
